# CLAUDE.md — Bhagavad Gita App Instructions

## Project Overview

This is a **Bhagavad Gita Interactive Learning App** — a full-stack React + Express web app (Vite, TypeScript, Firebase). All verse content lives in a single JSON file:

```
client/src/data/gitaData.json
```

TypeScript types for the data are in:

```
client/src/types/gita.ts
```

The UI that renders verse content is in:

```
client/src/pages/VersePage.tsx
```

The home page (hero, chapter cards, feature chips / dialogs) is in:

```
client/src/pages/Home.tsx
client/src/data/heroFeatureLabels.json
```

Edit `heroFeatureLabels.json` to change chip labels, descriptions, and chip styling tokens (`chipClass`) without touching layout logic in `Home.tsx` unless needed.

**Chapter-level synopses** (long-form summaries with optional images, separate from `gitaData.json` verses) use:

```
client/src/data/chapterSummaries.json
client/src/pages/ChapterSummaryPage.tsx
client/src/lib/chapterHeroImage.ts
client/public/chapter-summaries/
```

## Chapter summaries (Drive-backed)

These are **not** stored inside `gitaData.json`. They are imported from editorial sources (e.g. Google Drive) into JSON and ship with static images under `client/public/`.

### Files and responsibilities

| Piece | Path |
|-------|------|
| Data | `client/src/data/chapterSummaries.json` — object keyed by chapter number as a string (`"12"`, …). Prefer the **block** format: `content` array of `{ type: "h2" \| "p" \| "img", text?: string, src?: string }`, optional `sourceDoc`. A legacy `sections` shape is still supported by the page. |
| Page | `client/src/pages/ChapterSummaryPage.tsx` — renders blocks, hero, breadcrumbs, fallback when no JSON entry exists (points to the import doc). |
| Hero image helper | `client/src/lib/chapterHeroImage.ts` — `getChapterHeroImageUrl` for SEO/header (uses verse thumbnails where available). |
| Public images | `client/public/chapter-summaries/*.png` — reference in JSON as site-root paths, e.g. `/chapter-summaries/ch12-synopsis-img01.png`. Vite serves `client/public` from `/` in dev and copies it into `dist/public` on build. |
| Import / provenance | `scripts/import-chapter-synopsis.md` — workflow for turning Drive exports into JSON + assets. Optional source binaries under `docs/source/` (e.g. synopsis `.docx`). Drive naming aligns with folders like `chapter0012` and synopsis filenames. |

### Routing and SEO (do not regress)

- **`client/src/App.tsx`**: Import `ChapterSummaryPage` (not a duplicate summary component). Register **`/chapter/:chapterNum/summary` before `/chapter/:chapterNum`** — in wouter, the first matching route wins; the generic chapter route must come last among chapter routes.
- **`client/src/pages/ChapterPage.tsx`**: Keep the **View Chapter Summary** link to `/chapter/${chapterNum}/summary` so every chapter can open the summary route (rich content when present, friendly fallback otherwise).
- **`server/seo.ts`**: Keep `summaryMatch` for `/chapter/(\\d+)/summary` in `getMetaForUrl`, and include **`/chapter/{n}/summary` in the sitemap** for each chapter (not gated on optional `synopsis_content` in `gitaData`).

There must be **one** summary implementation: **`ChapterSummaryPage` + `chapterSummaries.json`**. Do not revive a separate page that only reads `synopsis_content` from `gitaData` without the JSON pipeline.

### Images for chapter summaries

- Unlike Firebase-backed verse images, synopsis illustrations are **checked into** `client/public/chapter-summaries/`. Do not invent URLs; add real files and reference them in `chapterSummaries.json`.

## Fix New Issue (Google Sheets)

**Master issue list (canonical):**  
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cCdjUu3Vx6i8NHewUy6OktW-b3fzPv0TpK_MStzuy_o/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cCdjUu3Vx6i8NHewUy6OktW-b3fzPv0TpK_MStzuy_o/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

When the user says **Fix New Issue** (same intent, any reasonable casing):

1. **Open that Google Sheet** and read the issue list (Status column).
2. **Work only on rows** whose status is **New Issue** or **Not Fixed** (match the sheet’s labels).
3. **Skip** rows whose status is **Completed** (or clearly equivalent “done” state).
4. Implement fixes **in sheet order** unless the user specifies otherwise.
5. **Do not** add repo-local Excel files, npm scripts, or dependencies for this workflow. If the sheet is not fetchable, use a **user-provided export** or pasted rows.
6. After fixing, the user may mark rows **Completed** in the sheet (the repo does not store sheet edits).

This workflow is also captured in `.cursor/rules/fix-new-issue.mdc` for Cursor agents.

## Your Task

**Populate the next verse with rich content, following the Chapter 12 Verse 1 gold standard.**

All **Chapter 12** `key_verses` in `gitaData.json` are fully enriched (same field set as the template). The other chapters still have sparse `key_verses` (basic fields only). Your job is to bring the **next** verse up to that depth.

### How to determine which verse to work on

1. Open `client/src/data/gitaData.json`.
2. Walk `chapters` in **chapter order** (ascending `chapter`). Within each chapter, consider `key_verses` in **verse number order**.
3. The **next** verse to enrich is the first `key_verse` missing **any** of: `meaning_detail`, `kids_content`, `detailed_meaning`, `more_stories`, `rich_grammar`.
4. Also check `chapter6_full[]` for Chapter 6: those entries still need the rich fields (and Chapter 6–specific conversion rules below).
5. If the user specifies a verse (e.g., "do 12.2" or "enrich 2.11"), work on that one instead.
6. Re-scan the file before editing—another commit may have filled the next gap.

### Reference verse (gold standard)

Use **Chapter 12 Verse 1** as the structural reference: in `gitaData.json`, find the chapter block with `"chapter": 12`, then the `key_verses` entry with `"verse": 1`. Do not rely on fixed line numbers; they shift as JSON grows.

## Content Schema — The Gold Standard

Every fully populated verse MUST have ALL of these fields. Use **Chapter 12 Verse 1** in `gitaData.json` as your reference (see above).

### Required Fields

```typescript
{
  "verse": number,              // verse number
  "chapter": number,            // chapter number
  "title": string,              // short evocative title (e.g., "The Question of Two Paths")
  "sanskrit": string,           // Devanagari śloka; closing ॥ on the last line (see editorial convention above)
  "transliteration": string,    // IAST transliteration with diacritics
  "one_line_meaning": string,   // single sentence English meaning
  "concise_journey": string,    // 2-3 sentence summary paragraph
  "meaning_detail": string,     // 2-4 paragraphs of detailed explanation (use \n\n between paragraphs)
  "story": string,              // a story from Mahabharata/Ramayana/Puranas illustrating the verse (3-5 paragraphs)
  "real_life_example": string,  // modern life application (2-3 paragraphs)
  "reflection": string,         // 2-3 contemplation questions (separated by \n)
  "kids_content": {
    "explanation_script": string,  // explain to a 6-10 year old (simple, friendly)
    "story": string,               // a simple parable/story a child can understand
    "reflection": string           // 2-3 questions for kids (separated by \n)
  },
  "detailed_meaning": string,   // step-by-step breakdown (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
  "more_stories": string,       // 2-3 numbered stories: "1. Story Title\nBody...\n\n2. Story Title\nBody..."
  "rich_grammar": {
    "padacchedah": string,       // word separation in Devanagari
    "pratipadarthah": string,    // word meanings: "word1 = meaning1 | word2 = meaning2 | ..."
    "anvayah": string,           // prose order reconstruction in Devanagari
    "sandhi": string,            // sandhi analysis: "word1 + word2 → combined | ..." (pipe-separated)
    "samasa": string,            // compound word analysis (pipe-separated)
    "other": string              // other grammar notes (pipe-separated)
  },
  "final_takeaway": string      // 2-3 sentence takeaway
}
```

### Optional Fields (add when applicable)

```typescript
{
  "audio_url": string,          // only if audio file exists in Firebase Storage
  "images": { ... }             // only if images exist — DO NOT fabricate image URLs
}
```

### Important Rules for Images

- **DO NOT** create or fabricate image URLs
- **DO NOT** add the `images` field unless real images already exist
- Images are uploaded separately by the admin through the app's UI
- Leave the `images` field out entirely for new verses

## Content Quality Guidelines

### Sanskrit & Transliteration
- Sanskrit MUST be accurate Devanagari. Follow the **in-repo convention**: do not paste `॥ch.v॥`-style labels on every line; the śloka closes with `॥` on the **last** line only (see existing Chapter 12 entries).
- IAST transliteration MUST use proper diacritical marks: ā, ī, ū, ṛ, ṭ, ḍ, ṇ, ś, ṣ, ṁ, ḥ
- Use `|` for half-verse break and `||` for full verse break in transliteration
- **Display:** `VersePage` strips trailing `chapter.verse॥` fragments from each transliteration line via `client/src/lib/transliterationDisplay.ts` so the visible IAST matches the Sanskrit line breaks without duplicating verse numbers on every line

### meaning_detail
- 2-4 substantive paragraphs separated by `\n\n`
- Explain the philosophical context, what Arjuna/Krishna is saying, and why it matters
- Reference previous chapters/verses for continuity

### story
- Use authentic stories from Mahabharata, Ramayana, Puranas, or Upanishads
- 3-5 paragraphs with narrative flow
- End with connection to the verse's teaching

### real_life_example
- Modern, relatable scenario (school, work, family, daily life)
- Show how the verse's teaching applies practically
- 2-3 paragraphs

### kids_content
- `explanation_script`: talk directly to the child ("You know how..."), use simple words
- `story`: a simple parable with concrete imagery (animals, children, everyday objects)
- `reflection`: 2-3 simple questions a child can think about

### detailed_meaning
- Format: "Step 1 — Topic (Sanskrit phrase):\nExplanation...\n\nStep 2 — ..."
- 4-6 steps breaking down each part of the verse
- Include Sanskrit terms with English explanations

### more_stories
- Format: "1. Story Title\nStory body...\n\n2. Story Title\nStory body..."
- 2-3 stories from different traditions (Panchatantra, saints' lives, Upanishadic insights)
- Each story should illustrate the verse from a different angle

### rich_grammar
- `padacchedah`: split compound words, show each word separately in Devanagari
- `pratipadarthah`: pipe-separated word-by-word meanings: `"word = meaning | word = meaning"`
- `anvayah`: reconstruct the verse in prose word order (Devanagari)
- `sandhi`: show phonetic combinations: `"word + word → combined"` (pipe-separated)
- `samasa`: identify compound types: `"compound → type"` (pipe-separated)
- `other`: verb forms, participles, etc. (pipe-separated)

## How to Edit gitaData.json

1. **Find the target verse** in the `chapters[].key_verses[]` array (or `chapter6_full[]`)
2. **If the verse exists** with basic fields, REPLACE it with the full rich version
3. **If the verse doesn't exist** as a key_verse, ADD it to the appropriate chapter's `key_verses` array in verse-number order
4. **Preserve all other data** — do not modify any other verses or chapters
5. **Validate JSON** — ensure the file is valid JSON after editing

### Bulk transliteration cleanup

To strip trailing `chapter.verse॥` suffixes from **all** `transliteration` fields in `key_verses` and `chapter6_full` (after a bad import or paste), from the repo root:

```bash
npm run strip-translit
```

This runs `scripts/strip-transliteration-json.mjs`. Review the diff before committing.

### For Chapter 6 Conversion

Chapter 6 verses already have `full_journey_text` and `grammar_notes` as flat text. When enriching these:
- Keep `full_journey_text` as-is (the UI renders it)
- ALSO add the new rich fields (`meaning_detail`, `kids_content`, `detailed_meaning`, `more_stories`, `rich_grammar`)
- Convert `grammar_notes` content into the structured `rich_grammar` format
- The `rich_grammar` structured format takes precedence in the UI over `grammar_notes`

## Reference Sources for Content

Use these authoritative sources for Bhagavad Gita content:
- Swami Paramarthananda's commentaries (Advaita Vedanta tradition)
- Adi Shankaracharya's Bhashya
- Swami Mukundananda's commentary (holy-bhagavad-gita.org)
- Swami Chinmayananda's commentary
- Mahabharata stories from Vyasa's original text

## Build & Verify

From the project root, after editing `gitaData.json`, `chapterSummaries.json`, or TypeScript:

```bash
npm run check
npm run build
```

This validates TypeScript and ensures JSON bundles correctly. Fix any errors before committing. After changing chapter summary images, confirm `/chapter/<n>/summary` in dev or preview and that image paths under `/chapter-summaries/` load.

Other useful scripts: `npm run strip-translit` (see above), `npm run format` (Prettier).
